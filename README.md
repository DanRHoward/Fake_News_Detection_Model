# Fake_News_Detection_Model
Using data available from kaggle, we shall conduct appropriate data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and train predictive models to determine whether a news article from our test set is FAKE or REAL. The dataset used for this project was in the form of a .csv file on kaggle. The dataset can be downloaded via the link below:

The files within this repository include:
- *requirements.txt*: This text file contains the dependencies that your virtual environment will need in order to run the python script.
- *detect_fake_news.ipynb*: This python interactive notebook contains the data story behind the whole process which concludes with the best performing model discovered.
- *Fake News Data Dashboard*: This file contains the Power BI dashboard, along with the relevent data, that attempts to visiualise the initial dataset used during this project. This bashboard, when loaded correctly, should look similar to the following:
